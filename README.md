# Spotify Playlist WebApp
Austin Maldonado, Max Murray, Israel Carcamo, Daniel McPherson

We are creating a Spotify webapp that will create playslists for listeners of songs they haven't heard before based on their listening history.

Audience is spotify users who aren't always happy with the spotify created playlists.

We are doing this becauuse the provided playlist creator on spotify has some flaws that could be improved upon.
