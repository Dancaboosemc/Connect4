# Connect Four Desktop App
Austin Maldonado, Max Murray, Israel Carcamo, Daniel McPherson

We have taken code designed for a 2 player Connect 4 console game. We are redesigninging to be easily implemented with GUI, 
designing our own GUI using java.swing, and adding features such as saving and loading games and implementing an AI player.

## General info
	Connect Four rules: 2 players take turns adding checkers to an 8x8 grid of spaces. Checkers are added into columns until the colums are filled (bottom to top).
	Someone wins when they get 4 of their pieces in a row (vetical, horizontal, or diagonal). If all spaces are filled without a declared winner, the game is a tie.

## Status
Austin - Leave of Absence

Daniel - GUI design, Implemented GUI (GameGUI.java): class extends Jframe from javax.swing. Jframe has the default layout. Has one panel that holds the all the buttons and the textbox. 
Core game buttons are implmented. Some buttons are place holders until other fetures are functional. Ex: save/load buttons. Had issues getting images to appear. 
Issue could be related to layout setting. Game board gui implemntation has been backlogged. Next steps are to redesign Jframe layout then address the board images.
