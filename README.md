# Connect Four Desktop App
Max Murray, Israel Carcamo, Daniel McPherson

We have taken code designed for a 2 player Connect 4 console game. We are redesigninging to be easily implemented with GUI, 
designing our own GUI using java.swing, and adding features such as saving and loading games and implementing an AI player.

## General info
	Connect Four rules: 2 players take turns adding checkers to an 8x8 grid of spaces. Checkers are added into columns until the colums are filled (bottom to top).
	Someone wins when they get 4 of their pieces in a row (vetical, horizontal, or diagonal). If all spaces are filled without a declared winner, the game is a tie.
